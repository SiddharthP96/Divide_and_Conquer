# Influence Maximization: Divide and Conquer

This repository provides an implementation of a framework for boosting the performance of influence maximization metrics by dividing a network into sectors of influence and selecting the most influential nodes within these sectors. The framework uses three different methodologies for sectoring networks: graph partitioning, graph hyperbolic embedding, and community structure. The repository also includes sample network data and examples of how to use the framework.

## Getting Started
To use the framework, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. 

<!-- ## Usage

The repository contains three different directories, each containing source code for a different methodology for sectoring networks: graph_partitioning, hyperbolic_embedding, and community_structure. Each directory contains a Python module that implements the corresponding methodology. The src/ directory contains the main code for the framework, including the algorithm for selecting the most influential nodes within each sector.

The data/ directory contains sample network data in the form of CSV files. The examples provided in the examples/ directory demonstrate how to use the framework on the provided sample data. To run an example, navigate to the corresponding directory in examples/ and run the Python script. For example, to run the hyperbolic embedding example, navigate to examples/hyperbolic_embedding/ and run the following command:
