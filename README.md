The divide and conquer algorithm improves the efficacy of heuristics solutions for influence maximization problem by leveraging different methodologies to divide the network into sectors. More details about the algorithm can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01203). The Jupyter notebook contains a short tutorial on the usage of the code to find influential spreaders. 


Please send any questions about the code or the algorithm to sidpatwa@iu.edu.
